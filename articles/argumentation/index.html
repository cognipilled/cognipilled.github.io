<em><span>This is a list in progress of discourse related behaviors that
frequently irk me when I’m talking to people. This can be anything from
clear dishonesty, to more unconscious dishonesty resulting from
cognitive dissonance, to small psychological defensive ticks, to vague
uninformative unclear statements, to anything else that annoys
me.</span></em></p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="hedging">Hedging</h1>
<p>Something added to lessen commitment, either by making it unclear
what’s being committed to, make the degree of commitment unclear, change
the type of commitment (that it’s just some sort of personal opinion
“just my opinion/I’m not an expert”). In general making what you’re
saying weaker so it’s more difficult to attack. “I was *just*
saying…”.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="crux-allergy">Crux Allergy</h1>
<p>People will often flinch every time a crux is put on the table.
They’ll claim something until a testable or more concrete proposition
that can be looked up is identified that their claim would hinge on (the
crux), then they’ll immediately walk back or weaken/make more uncertain
what they’ve previously claimed. “If X was true, would that change your
mind on Y?”</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="ironic-conceit">Ironic Conceit</h1>
<p>Especially defensive people will often agree to something ironically
(especially when conceding) to gain plausible deniability or to pretend
they didn’t ever take the discussion seriously. “Yes, you were SOO
right, I’m SOO wrong about this.” Dipping their toes into “I was just
trolling all laong man XD ” territory to see if it’s plausible
strategy.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="motte-and-bailey">Motte and Bailey</h1>
<p>Before being challenged: uttering something that when interpreted on
its face seems to obviously mean something very strong and controversial
which can be easily attacked, then when challenged: explains that what
they meant by the initial utterance was just something very weak and
uncontroversial. When challenger leaves they return to the original
strong sounding utterance.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="distancing-language">Distancing Language</h1>
<p>Phrasing that psychologically distances you from your statement.
Euphemism and hedging can be used for this purpose. Typical is the
avoidance of first person pronouns, passive voicing (a mistake was
made), using labels that give false implications “that woman”. A nice
concrete sign that someone is uncomfortable with being explicit.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="euphemism">Euphemism</h1>
<p>Expression that makes an utterance seem more innocuous, often as a
way to emotionally distance yourself from what’s being talked about. The
topic of euphemism is related to the discussion of when the emotional
valence of your language fits what you’re talking about. “Animal
holocaust.”</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="distinction-without-a-difference">Distinction
without a Difference</h1>
<p>People will often not agree to a characterization you give, then give
their characterization only for it not to contain any distinction that
actually makes a difference to what’s being talked about. This will
reveal whether someone is instinctively disagreeing with what you’re
saying which is evidence of dishonesty. It also occurs when they want to
reframe your characterization in more euphemistic language. It also
occurs when people want to not be lecured, they want to pretend like
they’re adding something to what’s being said so they don’t have to feel
inferior.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="question-dodging">Question Dodging</h1>
<p>...<br />
Like when people can’t even answer the most uncontroversial easiest
questions, there’s obviously some extreme dishonesty or cognitive
dissonance at play.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="fully-general-analogy-rejection">Fully
General Analogy Rejection</h1>

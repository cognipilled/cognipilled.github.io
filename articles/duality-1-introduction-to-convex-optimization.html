                <h2>Introduction to series</h2>
                 <p>
                    This is the first article in a series of articles about duality in optimization. 
                    This is a very beautiful topic, which pops up all over the place in applied maths, but also one I have unfortunately found it incredibly hard to understand. 
                    Fortunately, I think this might be due to the way the topic is presented in most textbooks.
                    And I think that I've found a way to present it that makes it geometrically clear what duality is all about.

                    In this article we will start with the simplest case of unconstrained optimization.
                    In the next case we will look at the constrained case.
                    This will involve the introduction of a fair number of tools, like lagrangians and the kkt conditions.
                    After this, we have the tools to derive duality proper. We will do that in the third article.
                    Finally, in the next three articles, we will look at two "applications" of the theory.
                    Existence of mixed strategy nash-equilibria in finite strategic games and Primal-dual methods in combinatorial optimization.

                 <p>
                    In an optimization probem, we are given a set \(X \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n\).
                    We are also given a function \(f: X \to \mathbb{R}\).
                    The goal is to find an \(x \in X\) such that \(f(x)\) is minimal.

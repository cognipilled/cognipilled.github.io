<h1 class="title">Visualization Exercises</h1>
<p class="author">hmys</p>

</header>
<p>This is an article that will list a number of visualization exercises
that I have found useful in improving my own visualization abillities.
It is a work in progress and I will continually update it as I find more
interesting exercises. Some of them are best done after you have
meditated, where your mind is in a very high degree of focus, some of
them can be done as their own form of meditation.</p>
<h2 id="lines-and-lines-and-lines">Lines and Lines and Lines</h2>
<p>The first exercise is the simplest one. You visualize n black equally
long lines on a white background. A good number to start with is two.
Then you visualize all possible permutations of 2-dimensional symbols
that can be created. For example, with two lines you can create an
L-shape, an x, a plus sign, a somewhat oddly proportioned T, a V, an A
without the middle line, and a few more. When this gets every easy (or
when you have exhaused all the permutations), you repeat the same
process with one more line. With three lines you can create an
equilateral triangle, and H, an ugly A, a "not equals" sign, a very
angular U, a pi symbol, a k, a fat I, a Z, you can place the three lines
connected only in one dot, so you get three lines pointing outwards like
a crosshair. And so on and so on.</p>
<h2 id="image-streaming">Image-Streaming</h2>
<p>Close your eyes, and image some scenery, then pick something in the
scenerey that stands out to you, then imagine moving towards it, picking
it up, looking at it. Then turn around and imagine moving somewhere. Try
to continually be moving, and to continually imagine new scenery for as
long as you can. To get yourself going you might want to start by
repeating some descriptions and words internally. An example: "sunny sky
beach, ocean, southern europe". I imagine I am at a beach. There are
beach balls, at it is very sunny. I turn around. There is a white house
made of some kind of sandstone. It has a singular oaken door. I walk
into the door. I am in a empty hallways that looks liminal. A woman with
brown hair walks past me. I enter the corridor, at the end there is
another door I open it. I am in an empty cafe that looks old with some
windows where sun shines through. I walk through the cafe. There are
tons of chars laying around, there are no people and no non-natural
light. It looks abandoned. I walk to the window. It is a backstreet,
looks like it could be in Northern Italy. I climb out. I look to the
right, the ground is made of old-looking stones. The street is about
three meters wide, and the buildings on both sides are very tall,
probably four stories or so and have red brick roofs........ And so it
goes for eternity.</p>
<h2 id="sharpening-intuitions-of-mental-space">Sharpening Intuitions of
Mental Space</h2>
<p>Imagine a rectangular grid made up of unit-squares. Then imagine a
rectangle whose first coordinate A is in (0,0), whose second coordinate
B is on the x-axis and whose third coordinate C is on the y-axis. Then
imagine rotating the line that stretches from C to B clockwise while the
point at C is fixed, until the line lays on the y-axis. Then count how
many units accross the origo the line falls. This is a way to mentally
compute the pythagorean theorem. I always found it very strange that I
can visualize a right triangle perfectly clearly in my mind, but that
when I do this exercise, I have a very hard time reading off the length
of the hypotenuse this way. Usually it is off by 30 percent or more. If
I imagine a triangle A = (0,0), B = (1,0), and C =(0,1), and I rotate BC
in the prescribed manned, its tip falls about 1/2 of a unit past the
x-axis. So <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{2}\)</span> should be Â 
1.5. This is actually not too bad, but for bigger number it becomes
exceedingly difficult. You can also use this technique to compute cos
and sin, but it is (I find) much much harder.</p>

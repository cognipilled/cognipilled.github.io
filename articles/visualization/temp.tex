The ability to visualize objects in your mind is an essential skill, especially in technical fields like mathematics, computer science and engineering. This article is compilation of useful exercises I've found for training your visualization ability. It also contains some general remarks and tips. The efficacy of the exercises are vastly improved if you do them in a mind-state of high focus, so doing them after meditating is probably a good idea. For meditation instructions see (###). The exercises are ranked roughly in order based on how how difficult and how technical they are.
